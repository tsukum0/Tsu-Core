# Tsu Core
## Before using
> [!NOTE]
> This command was created to **help developing your bot in BDFD**, with a lot of commands compacted in one. The indentation of this command is propositaly diferent, as it helped me (the developer) to code. (This means that you don't need to copy this indentation as it ins't needed when creating you code.)

> [!WARNING]
> The token of BDFD is required, be extremely careful while possesing the token in hands, and be careful in how store the token in the bot (as the creation of the variable "tsu.core" is needed, you can simply put your token as the global value of "tsu.core", then using a command of the **Tsu Core** to hide de token.)
